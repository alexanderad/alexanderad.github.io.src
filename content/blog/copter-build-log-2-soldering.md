#### Connectors Drama
Today I finished soldering of ESCs to engines connections and ESCs to power connectors. All of those require [Bullet 3.5mm Gold Connectors](http://www.nex-robotics.com/index.php?option=com_virtuemart&page=shop.product_details&flypage=flypage.tpl&product_id=928&Itemid=45) and I failed to calculate proper amount in advance (oh, shi). The thing is that needed amount is _at least_ 3 x 4 female (for ESCs to motors) + 4 x 2 male (ESCs to power) making in total 12 pairs, while I, being na√Øve, bought 20 pcs (or 10 _pairs_). 

The sad part of story is that in Ukraine a _pair of those_ costs something like $1.3, while from China you can get 10 pairs for $1.8 (paying extra 15 to 40 days for waiting for your order).

Beside that the process itself is not a rocket science, that is why no higher education is needed.

#### Next steps
* Wait for more connectors to arrive :-)
* Solder "1 to 4" power "multiplexors"
